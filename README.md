# StallmanBot
## A basic python discord bot that spams the GNU/Linux copypasta when someone says 'Linux' and not 'GNU/Linux'.

# Setup
**Python 3.5.3 or higher is required**

To install the discord library without full voice support, you can just run the following command:

.. code:: sh

    # Linux/OS X
    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
    
After that create a bot on the Discord Developer Portal and copy the token into the code where it says 
.. code:: py
    client.run('TOKEN')
