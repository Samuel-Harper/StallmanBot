# StallmanBot
#### A basic python discord bot that spams the [GNU/Linux copypasta](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Interjection) when someone says 'Linux' and not 'GNU/Linux'.

# Setup
**Python 3.5.3 or higher is required**

To install the discord library without full voice support, you can just run the following command:

    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py  
After that create a bot on the Discord Developer Portal and copy the token into the code where it says 
```python
client.run('TOKEN')
```
